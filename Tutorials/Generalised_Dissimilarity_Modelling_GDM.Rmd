# Frequently asked questions

## Y axis labelling
How should the y-axis be labelled?

There are different labels around, from very mathematical to more applied :
- "f(explanatory variable)" (Mokany Guide and Ferrier 2007)
- "partial ecological distance" (Fitzpatrick 2013, Fitzpatrick 2015)
-"Effect on beta-diversity" (Gossner 2016)

Personally recommended : last option, potentially "Partial effects on beta-diversity" because easiest to understand.
